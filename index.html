                Kayne Rodrigo, as a Computer Science student in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, has made small steps to create contributions to technology, business, and the country. As a participant in the previous HackForGov2 CERT PH: Capture-the-Flag Competition 2023 from the Department of Information Communications and Technology, he strived well to capture at least 5 flags which helped his team land in 11th place in the competition. Additionally, he previously dedicated himself as a Data Analyst from a Virtual Apprenticeship Program to create forecasting and visualization dashboards and spreadsheets for a local company which helped them have a data-driven decision for their business operations. Furthermore, during his first year, he landed his first internship as a Digital Marketing Intern at a Korean-based Startup Company wherein he created digital pub mats and promotional videos. Kayne believes that as we learn to work in a data-processing field, we must learn how to work in a secure environment. Therefore, he is interested in learning fields of Data Science and Cybersecurity. He believes that nurturing skills from both Data Analysis and Cybersecurity will provide the best practices in honing data-driven solutions and secure from security risks involved in data technology.
